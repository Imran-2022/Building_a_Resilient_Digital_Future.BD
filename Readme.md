#### üìñ Introduction
In today‚Äôs digital world, cybersecurity and data protection have become essential for every country. As Bangladesh rapidly advances in digital transformation, strong and modern cyber laws are crucial to ensure safety, trust, and fairness online. However, past cyber laws in the country have often faced criticism for being either too vague or too harsh, leading to misuse and public concern.

This assignment explores the evolution of cyber laws in Bangladesh and compares them with those of leading countries like the USA, UK, EU nations, and others. It highlights the strengths and weaknesses of current Bangladeshi laws and proposes legal reforms based on successful global examples. By adopting these changes, Bangladesh can build a more resilient, rights-respecting, and globally connected digital future.
